# Deep Dive

i focused on implementation logic instead of designing full production ready reusable components. These are living proof of my front-end expertise.

## warnings

- onOpenChange like props can be part of deps array, ensure you pass stable func. ref to get performance boost

## info

i first build hook to get sneak peak of logic then i used 3 third-party utils instead of reinventing the wheel to move fast since i developed these components to deep-dive so implement only to get the logic and standing on the shoulders of gaints is fine.

- @base-ui/utils/useControlled
- @base-ui/utils/useScrollLock
- focus-trap-react
